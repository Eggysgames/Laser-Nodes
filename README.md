Laser Nodes is based on my old Flash Game Nodes. It's a simple concept of lining the laser through the nodes, but the idea became more popular after it. In the Unity version I improved it with reflections and URP effects. It also uses a custom moving shaders for the laser to give it a glowing effect.

=== Developer Information === 

Made for Unity version 2021.3.11f1 (Opening in different versions can cause unexpected errors)

Developed using Unity by Eggy's Games (Bradley Erkelens).

=== Coding === 

All code refers to the Main.cs class

You will find the most important class is ReflectRays.cs which has code to reflect rays off different objects on screen. The reflection can go on 99 times. This allows dynamic hittesting between a line on screen and any object you want.
